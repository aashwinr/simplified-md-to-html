# Simplified md to html converter

> ## About the Syntax
- The syntax for this version of this simplified markdown is slightly different from the original.
- It is trivial to modify the code in order to support the original syntax, I just think this is more clear.

> ## Converter
- The converter just provides a basic html file with no styles.
- To style the quotes target the `quote` class

> ## Same as the old one but slightly more manageable
- Simplified Lexer/Tokenizer
  - The previous did too much and did some work that was supposed to be done by the parser.
  - Parsing regular text was unnecessarily complicated in the previous version.
